## Description

This is a simple Todo list application created as the job task for `Qtec Solution Limited`. I have mainly used `Next.js`, `TypeScript`, `TailwindCSS` etc. to develop this application. The features of the application is described below.

## Features

- User can add new task into the task list here.
- User can delete existing task into the task list here.
- User can edit existing task into the task list here.
- User can `mark as complete` an existing task here.
- I have used `local storage` to persist data even if user refreshes the page
- I have created a `filter` option by using which, user can filter the tasks based on `priority`.
- The whole project is responsive throughout `mobiles, tablets & computers`.
- I have used `context API` to manage data throughout the application.
